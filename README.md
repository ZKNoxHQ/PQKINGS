ETHPRAGUE 7702 Hybrid Account ( Legacy + Post Quantum)

## DESCRIPTION

## WHAT WILL BE DEMONSTRATED

The ETHPRAGUE wristbands are turned into Ethereum signers using the ARX chip it contains. It has been decided that the major threat is not the lack of secure screen but rather the Quantum 
Computer that will be shipped next week (or a bit later). To resist the threat, a Post Quantum signer is added into a 7702 smart account, providing Hybrid Cryptography protection.

## HOW DOES IT WORKS

## INSTALLATION

The [ZKNOX/ETHFALCON](https://github.com/ZKNoxHQ/ETHFALCON) repository has been forked for the hackathon. Find installation instructions for it there.
